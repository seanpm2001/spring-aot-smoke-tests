= Spring AOT Smoke Tests

A suite of tests for applications using AOT on the JVM and in GraalVM native images.
There are two types of tests: unit tests and application tests.

Unit tests are processed ahead of time and are then either run on the JVM or as a native executable.
Unit tests can be run on the JVM using the `test` task and as a native executable using the `nativeTest` task.

Application tests are always executed on the JVM against an application that's running on the JVM or as a native executable.
The `appTest` task tests the application running on the JVM.The `nativeAppTest` task tests the application running as a native executable.

== How to

=== Run all of a project's smoke tests

[source,]
----
./gradlew :<name of the group>:<name of the smoke test>:build
----

for example

[source,]
----
./gradlew :boot:actuator-webmvc:build
----

=== Run a specific type of tests for a project

[source,]
----
./gradlew :<name of the group>:<name of the smoke test>:<test task name>
----

Valid test task names are:

1. `appTest` – tests the application running on the JVM
2. `nativeAppTest` – tests the application running as a native executable
3. `test` – executes the AOT-processed unit tests on the JVM
4. `nativeTest` – executes the AOT-processed unit tests in a native executable

for example

[source,]
----
./gradlew :boot:actuator-webmvc:appTest
----

=== Add a new smoke test

1. Create a new directory for your smoke test in the appropriate group
2. Include the directory in `settings.gradle` (new groups only)
3. Run `./gradlew <name of the group>:name of the smoke test>:generateGitHubActionsWorkflow` to generate a GitHub Actions workflow for the smoke test

=== Test against local changes

==== Your project uses Gradle

[source,]
----
./gradlew :<name of the group>:<name of the smoke test>:build --include-build /path/to/your/project
----

Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html#command_line_composite[will then substitute the dependency] with your provided version.

_Hint: You can use `--include-build` multiple times._

==== Your project uses Maven or --include-build does not work

First, install the snapshots into your local Maven cache.
You can now consume those snapshots using `-PfromMavenLocal` which takes a comma-separated list of group IDs:

[source,]
----
./gradlew :rest-template:build -PfromMavenLocal=org.springframework,org.springframework.data
----

The preceding example will run the `rest-template` smoke test, resolving Spring Framework and Spring Data modules from your local Maven cache.

=== Using snapshots

By default, the smoke tests will use snapshots of `org.springframework.*` dependencies.
Note that `org.springframework.boot` and `org.springframework.cloud` dependencies are not affected.
Their versions are controlled by the `springBootVersion` and `springCloudVersion` properties defined in `gradle.properties`.

For each eligible dependency, the snapshot version that is used is derived from the dependency's default version:

- `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT` is left as-is
- `x.y.z` is changed to `x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT`
- `x.y.z-Mn` is changed to `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT`
- `x.y.z-RCn` is changed to `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT`

To disable this behavior, set the `forceSnapshots` property to `false`, as shown in the following example:

[source,]
----
./gradlew :boot:actuator-webmvc:build -PforceSnapshots=false
----

=== Override a dependency version

As the test doesn't use the Spring Dependency Management Plugin, you can't use the `ext['...'] = '...'` method.

Instead, use https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_constraints.html[Gradle dependency constraints].
Say, for example, you want to update the version of Spring Session JDBC to `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`:

[source,]
----
dependencies {
    // ...
    constraints {
        implementation('org.springframework.session:spring-session-jdbc:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT')
    }
}
----

This works for direct and transitive dependencies.
